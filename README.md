# Data Visualization of how Covid-19 has affected US flight patterns
This project is a map visualization of how Covid-19 has affected US flight patters. The visualization uses edge bundling on top of a choropleth/proportional symbol map. 
The project has been implemented in JS/D3.js with data coming from CSV/TopoJSON.

A video of the prototype is available here, explained by Erik: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-oN8OMeHBY-Oj8Z-PJEK0bcOUWlysItx/view?usp=sharing
